                        A world-class track cyclist and Olympic silver medalist in speed skating, John K. Coyle has been moving counterclockwise and chasing time from an early age. 
                        A subsequent stint designing trading systems at Enron to increase trade velocity only served to exacerbate Coyle’s obsession with time.

                        A professor of innovation, Coyle is also a thought leader in the field of horology. Coyle studies the cognitive biases and errors that govern “experiential time” 
                        and explores ways to slow, stop and reverse the acceleration of the ticking of the clock in service of the most precious commodity we have: time.
